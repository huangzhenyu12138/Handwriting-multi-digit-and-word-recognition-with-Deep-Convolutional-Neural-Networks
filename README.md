Handwriting multi-digit and word recognition with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks

digits.py is used to generate model parameters and save them to a file.
handing_digits.py is used to recognise multi-digit pictures.
character.py is used to generate CNN recognition alphabet model parameters.
handing_character.py s used to identify words.
We only uploaded the trained model parameter files and not the MNIST and EMNIST datasets.
